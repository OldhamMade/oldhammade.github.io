Hot on the heels of the launch of [XML-tool.net](http://xml-tool.net) comes 
[JSON-tool.net](http://json-tool.net), a simple tool to reformat and transform
JSON data. 

Why do we need yet *another* JSON tool on the web, when we have such useful ones like
[JSBeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/)? While this tool might not be as fully-featured
as JSBeautifier when it comes to reformatting, it handles simple requirements well
and has the ability to transfor JSON into other formats.

Current features include:

- the ability to [reformat](http://json-tool.net/reformat) YAML
- the ability to [convert JSON to YAML](http://json-tool.net/transform/to-yaml/)
- the ability to [convert JSON to Simple XML](http://json-tool.net/transform/to-xml/)

Enjoy!
