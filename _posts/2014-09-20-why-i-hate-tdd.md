I know, another article with an inflamatory title. But it's true. I really do hate Test Driven Development.

However, let me clarify that statement. I hate TDD *in Python*.

Please don't get me wrong: I love testing. I advocate testing. I think testing in Python is great too. Yet when I see TDD tests written in Python, they make me want to claw my eyes out. They're so... unreadable.

One of the primary reasons people use Python is because of it's inherent readability. There are [rules regarding formatting], there are guidelines on [how to document] our code, there's even [the Zen]. But there's nothing on how to write good tests, specifically test names, in Python.

Some code I was looking through on github recently had a test class that was basically the following:

    class TestProduct(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_description(self):
            ...

I spent some time trying to work out what `test_description` did, and it seemed pretty straight-forward, but for the life of me I couldn't work out *why* the developer hadn't specified *what* they were testing, and what the expected outcome was.

Well, sure, they had described what they were testing. They were testing something to do with the `description` on a `Product`. But at a cursory glance I couldn't work out what they were trying to test. Or, rather, what they were trying to ensure was happening within the test from it's name -- what outcome they were expecting.

People lament Behaviour-Driven Development practices. They say it's over-complicated and unnecessary. And I think they're right. The BDD tools have gotten way to big, they're too much of a time investment.

It doesn't have to be this way. You don't need the stories. You don't need the **Given**, **When**, **Then** scenarios.

It can be really simple. In fact, you only need to do one thing:

**Make the test name describe what you're trying to achieve.**

You already make your variable names descriptive. You make your function/method names descriptive. You write your code so that it tells a little store. Then you give you and write crappy test names. Why?!

Let's make the above example better by adding a little narative element, so you can see what I mean.

    class BasicProductTests(unittest.TestCase):
        """Ensuring that basic interaction with
        Product objects is simple and correct"""

        def test_description_accepts_a_string(self):
            ...

        def test_description_accepts_unicode(self):
            ...

        def test_description_raises_when_not_given_a_string(self):
            ...

        def test_description_raises_when_empty_on_save(self):
            ...

This will still work with nose. Your tests will still run. And your co-workers won't [stab you in the neck with a pencil].
