Following the launch of [YAML-tool.net](http://yaml-tool.net), I've found need for
reformatting XML so have created [XML-tool.net](http://xml-tool.net), a simple tool 
to work with YAML data. 

Current features include the ability to [pretty print](http://xml-tool.net/reformat) XML
while removing/including things like the XML declration and namespaces.

As usual, feature requests are welcome.
