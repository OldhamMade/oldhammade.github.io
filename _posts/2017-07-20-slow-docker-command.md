It's been a little while since I've used `docker`, and I found that running the command on
the terminal would simply hang, even when running `docker -v`. A quick check showed that it
would take around 32s to run:

    $ time docker -v
    Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
    docker -v  0.01s user 0.02s system 0% cpu 32.064 total

After some digging around, I found that this was because I had some old `DOCKER_*` env vars
loaded into my environment. You can check your environment by running the following:

    $ set|grep DOCKER
  
The super simple fix was to make sure my docker machine was running, and then eval 
the `docker-machine env` command, thusly:

    $ eval $(docker-machine env my-machine)
  
It seems that the `docker` command was simply timing out when trying to connect to the machine;
spinning up a machine to respond, and setting the correct env vars, sees the problem go away.
