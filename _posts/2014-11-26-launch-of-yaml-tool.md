After an action-packed summer visiting EuroPython and working with an exciting new client,
I've recently found some time to launch another in a line of online tools I have planned.

[YAML-tool.net](http://yaml-tool.net) is a simple tool to work with YAML data. Current
features include:

- the ability to [reformat](http://yaml-tool.net/reformat) YAML
- the ability to [convert YAML to JSON](http://yaml-tool.net/transform/to-json/)
- the ability to [convert YAML to Simple XML](http://yaml-tool.net/transform/to-xml/)

Feature requests are always welcome.

I hope you find it as useful as I do!
