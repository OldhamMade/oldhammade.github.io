Oldham-Made is 5 years old!

Since our 3-year anniversary --- which saw Oldham-Made work with a number of UK broadcasters, including the BBC 
and another well-known UK TV brand, some household names in retail, and a Fortune-500 company --- lots has changed and lots has stayed the same.

There was a short return to the Fortune-500 company. Oldham-Made helped a key player in media and entertainment industry launch an MVP which has since seen partnerships with companies such as Disney and Paramount Pictures. We also assisted with more spikes for for the well-known UK TV brand's Amazon FireTV app.

And currently Oldham-Made is proud to be facilitating some long-term development projects around the World Food Programme's SCOPE system.
