With a heavy heart I must announce that **Oldham-Made Ltd** is closing
down.

It's been a great 6 years, but due to the uncertainty of Brexit I've
had to reassess the future, for the business, for myself, and for my
family, and I've had to make the soul-wrenching decision to close the
business and relocate away from the UK.

Oldham-Made Ltd has been lucky to work with some amazing clients on some
truly inspiring projects, including:

* The BBC's Knowledge and Learning department, helping to modernise
  their Bitesize GCSE revision content by processing 10 years' worth
  of XML and migrating it into their new XML-based content management
  system.
* UKTV, assisting with the development of their UKTVPlay TV &
  set-top-box application.
* Bank of America Merrill Lynch, across of a number of projects and
  teams.
* Sainsburys, building a middleware API for an in-store mobile
  shopping proof-of-concept.
* Sohonet, helping to get their ClearView Flex tool from
  proof-of-concept through to MVP and into the offices and daily
  workflows of some of the biggest names in the media industry,
  including Disney, Paramount Pictures, and Netflix.
* The United Nations World Food Programme, helping to coordinate
  development efforts between the UK, Rome, and Bangkok development
  teams to reintegrate changes between the primary codebase and a
  3-year old fork.

Oldham-Made Ltd business was originally started to provide the weath
of my experience to clients on a short-term basis, and also to provide
me personally with more financial stability and flexibility in my work
schedule so that I could give help and assistance to my parents and
relatives.

However, Brexit has removed any sense of stability in the UK, and the UK
government is making it increasingly more difficult for small businesses
to operate. While a hard-brexit wouldn't affect my business directly,
the indirect effects are unpredictable and incalculable, and I need to
look elsewhere To provide the stability both I and my family need.

While the UK business is closing down, I'll personally be keeping the
brand alive and will continue to release and maintain open-source
projects under the OldhamMade repository on github, and will continue
to personally host the closed-source, free-to-use tools developed over
the years.

My hope is that in the future Oldham-Made can start providing consultancy
services again, from a new base in the EU.
