With a heavy heart I must announce that **Oldham-Made Ltd** is closing
down.

It's been a great 6 years, but due to the uncertainty of Brexit I've
had to reassess the future, for the business, for myself, and for my
family, and I've had to make the soul-wrenching decision to close the
business and relocate away from the UK.

Oldham-Made Ltd has been lucky to work with some amazing clients on some
truly inspiring projects, including:

* The BBC's Knowledge and Learning department, helping to modernise
  their Bitesize GCSE revision content by processing 10 years' worth
  of XML and migrating it into their new XML-based content management
  system.
* UKTV, assisting with the development of their UKTVPlay
  TV/set-top-box application.
* Bank of America Merrill Lynch, working across of a number of
  projects and teams.
* Sainsburys, building a middleware API for an in-store mobile
  shopping proof-of-concept.
* Sohonet, helping to get their ClearView Flex tool from
  proof-of-concept through to MVP and into the offices and daily
  workflows of some of the biggest names in the media industry,
  including Disney, Paramount Pictures, and Netflix.
* The United Nations World Food Programme, helping to coordinate
  efforts between the UK, Rome, and Bangkok development teams to
  reintegrate changes between the primary codebase and a 3-year old
  fork.

Oldham-Made Ltd was originally started to provide the weath of my
experience to clients on a short-term basis, and also to provide me
personally with more financial stability and flexibility in my work
schedule so that I could give help and assistance to my parents and
relatives.

However, Brexit has removed any sense of stability in the UK, and the
UK government is making it increasingly difficult for small businesses
to operate. While a hard-Brexit wouldn't affect my business directly,
the indirect effects of any kind of Brexit, including the Brexit
process the UK is currently undergoing, are unpredictable and
incalculable. I've found that I need to look elsewhere to provide the
stability both I and my family need.

While the UK business is closing down, I'll personally be keeping the
brand alive and will continue to release and maintain open-source
projects under the OldhamMade repository on github, and will continue
to personally host the closed-source, free-to-use tools developed over
the years.

My hope is that in the future Oldham-Made can start providing
consultancy services again, albeit from a new base in the EU. And I'd
like to wish other, similar small businesses in the UK the best of
luck during this trying period.
