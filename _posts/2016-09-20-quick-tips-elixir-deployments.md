If you see an error like the following:

    [info] Application myapp exited: MyApp.start(:normal, []) returned an error: shutdown: failed to start child: MyApp.Endpoint
        ** (EXIT) shutdown: failed to start child: Phoenix.CodeReloader.Server
  
...try rerunning the release with both `MIX_ENV` and `--env` set to the same env. For example:
   
    MIX_ENV=prod mix release --env=prod
