A new addition to the family of [YAML-tool](http://yaml-tool.net), [XML-tool.net](http://xml-tool.net), and
[JSON-tool.net](http://json-tool.net) comes [Python-tool](http://python-tool.net), a simple tool to reformat Python output. 

Why do we need this tool when we have [the pprint module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html)?
Something programmers do a lot during development is to print out large data structures so
we can make sense of them. This tool will help pretty print such output when you're unable 
to do so, or have missed the opportunity to do so, in your code.

Current features include:

- the ability to [reformat](http://python-tool.net/reformat) output of Python data-types
- the ability to [convert JSON](http://python-tool.net/transform/to-json/)
- the ability to [convert to YAML](http://python-tool.net/transform/to-yaml/)
- the ability to [convert to Simple XML](http://python-tool.net/transform/to-xml/)

Enjoy!
