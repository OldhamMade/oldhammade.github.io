We noticed that our servers' clocks were slightly off. Adding the following to our /etc/rc.local file keeps our servers updated whenever it boots:

    set -- `nc time.nist.gov 13`
    date -u --set="$2 $3"

I've also added it to our cron.daily so there's no slip while the servers are running.

On this particular server we were resource-limited, so installing `ntpd` wasn't an option. However, if you have the resources then this would be the preferred approach.
